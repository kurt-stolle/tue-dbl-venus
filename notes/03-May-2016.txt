1.
	A: Done. Testing after the meeting.
	B: Forgot switch for the motor power. It is now fine, robot could move.
	Ultrasonic sensor is still to be tested.
	C: Done. Did not hand in the report in time (because of confusion with time
	notation), but it has been fixed.
	D: Ordered, expecting them to arrive within a month.
	
	Extra points: We didn't get an answer to the questions we
	had last week, but we figured it out anyway. Not a problem
	anymore.
2.
	A: Planning to do this after the meeting.
	B: Concurrency needed, trying to find a workaround for that since
	an Arduino doesn't support multithreading. Focus will be on
	utility functions and strategy for now. Algorithm will be developed
	later.
	C: After the meeting.
	D: As we missed the deadline, our design report will not be peer reviewed.
	As a solution we can ask friends to review our report anyway (3 friends per member).
	
	Extra points: No ghantt chart was made, we really should according to Dogus.
3.
	Kurt & Loek: utility functions.
	Tim & Niels & Marius: write test sequences & fix hardware.
	
	A more specific division will be made after the meeting.
4.
	It was discussed that Office 365 (2016) might be more
	convenient for the final report, since we will be able to work
	simultaneously. Office is free for students, so obtaining a license 
	will not be a problem.
	
	We don't really have an indication of the progress of other groups. Dogus
	suggests to just stick our nose in the business of other groups and
	see how they are doing ;).
	
	Dogus wants more participation from everyone, and does not want one
	person to do everything at the same time.
